AppShortSummary = Standalone Archipelago client
AppDescription = """
    Fully-functional standalone Windows/Mac/Linux client for Archipelago, specializing in Manual for Archipelago.

    Many features address usability concerns over the original manual client:
    - Accident-proof; You must tick a checkbox, press the 'Release' button, and confirm the release again by holding down a separate button.
    - Out-of-logic is highlighted; Locations not in logic are invisible by default, colored red, and a warning message appears when trying to break logic.
    - Drag-and-drop; YAML files can be dropped into the window to immediately start a session.
    - Highlights BK; Shows 'BK' and 'Done' to efficiently communicate the status of a manual slot.

    It also includes other quality-of-life features to minimize setup time:
    - Manage multiple sessions at the same time in one window, no need to open the application multiple times for each slot.
    - Ability to communicate in the chat, see locations, and items, filtering with a search.
    - Remembers the last server you logged in, automatically filling in the details upon startup.
    - Highly customizable UI scaling and theming to ensure ease-of-use.
    - Window can be resized to any resolution.
