AppDescription = """
    Fully-functional standalone Windows/Mac/Linux client for Archipelago, specializing in Manual for Archipelago.

    Many features address usability concerns over the original manual client:
    - Accident-proof; You tick a checkbox, press the "Release" button, and confirm the release again by holding down a separate button. This can also be configured to be less explicit.
    - Drag-and-drop; YAML files can be dropped into the window to immediately start a session. You can also copy paste the file path to achieve the same result.
    - Out-of-logic is highlighted; Locations not in logic are invisible by default, colored red, and a warning message appears when trying to break logic. Additionally, hovering over these locations will showcase the items required.
    - Consumable item tracking; Mark items as "consumed", to keep track of whether you resolved temporary fillers or traps.
    - Slot-defined category; Locations can be moved to a special category that is always on top. The purpose is left for the user, such as a "try later" list, a priority list, or hinted locations.
    - Chat autocomplete; When typing in chat, suggestions for commands and names of items will show up. Can be disabled.
    - Notifications; You can enable push notifications for receiving new items, as long as you leave the slot open.
    - DeathLink support; Send and receive DeathLink notices. Remote offers a toggle to crash the application when a DeathLink is received, but by adding your own file watcher over the file `DeathLink` in your temporary directory, you can make your computer or game do anything upon death!
    - Highlights BK; Shows "BK" and "Done" to efficiently communicate the status of a manual slot.

    It also includes other quality-of-life features to minimize setup time:
    - Manage multiple sessions at the same time in one window, no need to open the application multiple times for each slot.
    - Ability to communicate in the chat, see hints, locations, and items, all with sort and filter options.
    - Remembers which servers you logged into, allowing you to immediately jump right back into a slot when opening the application again.
    - Extensive UI scaling and theming, as well as font alternatives for accessibility.
    - Specify `REMOTE_HISTORY_PATH` to change the path of the `history.json` file.
    - Specify `REMOTE_PREFERENCES_PATH` to change the path of the `preferences.cfg` file.
